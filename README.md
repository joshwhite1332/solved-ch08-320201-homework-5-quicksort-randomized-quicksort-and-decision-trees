 <li><em>Implement </em>a modified version of the Quicksort algorithm, where the sequence is always split into three subsequences by simultaneously using the first two elements as pivots.</li>

 <li>Derive the best-case and worst-case running time for the modified Quicksort in (a).</li>

 <li><em>Implement </em>a modified version of the Randomized Quicksort algorithm, where the sequence is always split into three subsequences by simultaneously using two random elements as pivots.</li>

<strong>Problem 2: Randomized Quicksort                                                                                                                   </strong>

To formally complete the proof of the expected time complexity <em>E</em>[<em>T</em>(<em>n</em>)] for the Randomized Quicksort algorithm when applied to an input sequence of length n, provide the following steps:

<ul>

 <li>Show by induction that</li>

 <li>Show by induction that</li>

</ul>

<em>E</em>[<em>T</em>(<em>n</em>)] ≥<em>cn</em>lg<em>n</em>

for a constant <em>c&gt; </em>0.
